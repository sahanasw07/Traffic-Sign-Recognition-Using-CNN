# Traffic Sign Recognition Using CNN

## 📌 Project Description
This project implements a Deep Learning-based Traffic Sign Recognition system using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The model is trained on the German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB) dataset and can perform real-time traffic sign recognition using a webcam.

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn

## 📂 Dataset
